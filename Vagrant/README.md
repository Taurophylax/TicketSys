# Vagrant for testing

- Install Vagrant
- Install VirtualBox (or another VM host that Vagrant supports)
- From TicketSys repo root:
- $ cd Vagrant
- $ vagrant up
- Web server should be running on localhost:8080

Todo: 

- Configure MySQL to work with TicketSys (add user)
- Create new Vagrant box with LAMP stack already installed (reduce startup time)
- Make sure services are configured to start on boot
