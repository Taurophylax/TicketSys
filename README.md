# TicketSys
A Ticket System

TODO

- Add user accounts and privileges (session or cookies?)
- Add multiple notes with timestamps (instead of just 1 per ticket)
- Multiple color schemes
- Improve filter search (keywords, wildcards, etc...)
- Improve UI appearance, especially for the ticket edit section.
- Create an installation script for MySQL
- Overhaul UI: See below.

Overhaul UI:
The use of modals were experimental. While very slick and sexy, I don't know that they support the fluidity of the rest of the UI. Maybe we need to rethink the entire UI? It's clean, but ugly.

- DONE Create and edit tickets
- DONE Search tickets using very basic filtering.
- DONE Close tickets
- DONE Divide code in to seperate files to improve readability
